# Workout buddy

Hello! Welcome to my third project, a workout buddy application. The application supports CRUD operations, creating workouts, retrieving workouts, updating workouts, and deleting workouts.

The front end uses ReactJS and Bootstrap for styling. The backend is powered with NodeJS using Express and MongoDB. HTTTP requests are handled using JavaScript's fetch API. 

Thank you for checking out my project!
